# back-end-php
This project contains resources for CodeLouisville's PHP track.

For the CodeLouisville PHP track we encourage you to install PHP on your machine so you can develop locally. We have provided a guide for [Installing PHP](Install.md) on Windows, Mac OS X, or Unix.

We have also setup some *optional*, but *recommended* [PHP Code Exercises](exercises/README.md) to compliment the course.
